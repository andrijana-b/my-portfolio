                <p class="cs-paragraph">
                    Sugarwish is a unique gifting startup company based in Denver, Colorado. With a Sugarwish, the gift
                    buyer is able to send an e-gift card digitally with no mailing address required. The gift recipient
                    receives the eCard and is invited to go to the Sugarwish website to pick their favorite treats or
                    beverages.

                    As part of the UX/UI Academy at Brainster, we were asked to work on redesign on small subset of

            <span class="fw-bold">Choose a type of gift,
            Choose a size, Choose an Ecard and Recipient Details</span>. There are some intricacies and side-flows at

        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            We kicked off the project by conducted stakeholder interview to get more insights, which helped me to make
            the right decisions and avoid end moment disappointments. During this stakeholder interview, I learned that
            the purpose of the redesign has been tackled several times and the
            <span class="fw-bold">highest bounce rate</span> is on the
            <span class="fw-bold">page choose an e-card</span> and second on
            <span class="fw-bold">choose a size page</span>.
            With this information, I conducted a UX assessment to understand
            what needed to change to create the experience the client was desiring and meet user needs. The UX
            assessment included: Competitive UX analysis, Usability heuristic evaluation, Google reviews.

        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            Here are few questions that I asked:

            <li>What are the growth metrics for the next 5 years?</li>
            <li>What are your unique selling points?</li>
            <li>Are there any design constraints? If yes, what are they?</li>
            <li>Because this is redesign, in which phase of the user flow is high bounce rate?</li>
            <li>Is there any features on your website that give you advantage over your competitors?</li>

        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            Usability tests were conducted before any other research to determine the areas of the website that users
            found confusing and to potentially discover the existing pain-points.
            <span class="fw-bold">The usability test’s goal is to uncover flaws and things that are not straightforward

            <li>Visit <a href="https://sugarwish.com/" target="_blank">www.sugarwish.com</a> and buy medium box of candy

            User interviews were conducted after the usability testing so that I could understand better the users and
            what their needs and frustrations were. I conducted 3 face to face user interviews to understand their
            frustrations. The biggest surprise was some of the users considered that the site might be a <span

            via the option <span class="fw-bold">"send the card via FB" there is no entry point for that particular information</span>.
            The other
            given options for sending the eCard are Messaging and Print which were also not clear how they work and
            users were in doubt how to use them, and who print the card.

        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            <span class="fw-bold">E-cards page</span>, users found the design of the cards a little <span

            their favorites within that product category. But even though the select is the most unique product and
            represents as high as 80% of Sugarwish sales user were confused about the product option <span

            <li>Introduce progress bar to reduce uncertainty and indicate the stage of the ordering process</li>

            According to Jacob’s Law, users prefer every site to work the same way as all the other sites they already
            know, therefore we embedded our decisions in the ux theories and common e-commerce practices. We based
            almost all our descriptions and solutions on the results that we got from our usability testings. One that
            help us determine the pain points on the website and another that helped us to check whether our solutions
            have improved the same.

                    there is so much “business” they have to do which prevents them from completing the order.
                    On the other hand, some remarked that the messaging/facebook option looks like spam, while for the
                    printing option it is not clear who prints the card and how.

                    To avoid further frustrations and confusion I designed page where I added all this features where

            We feel that from all the teams Sharks had the best desktop solution for the flow. We liked the size
            presentations on the Choose size screen and the simple filters for the eCards. The recipient page was a
            little messy, but it still followed established patterns. We appreciated the complete approach that the
            group took before dealing with the actual problems. Based on their studies they identified specific
            issues
            (aka pain points) and addressed them accordingly.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph outcomes">
            It would have been great to see how the group would address the mobile flow, but the absence of mobile
            screens is not taken as a negative.

        <h1 class="cs-section-title spacer-up">Lessons learned, and where we go from here</h1>
        <p class="cs-paragraph outcomes">
            It was a fun yet quite challenging experience working on this project because it was first time for me doing
            re-design on small subset of screens of already existing website.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph outcomes">
            This project taught me how to work within the constraints of an existing product and design within an
            existing system, relying on already present design patterns and components. Since users are already familiar
            with these conventions, breaking them could hurt usability.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph outcomes">
            Most importantly I learnt that the first ideas for the website are only the beginning of the design process
            and "no design is perfect, there is always a room for improvements". Usability testing and feedback
            influenced each iteration of the sugarwish ordering flow design and that point to me to appreciate gradual
            improvement rather than striving to perfectionism.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph outcomes">
            Based on the feedback of the stakeholder, the next steps for this project are to work on iteration on "The
            recipient page" and get it into the hands of more users for further validation. Create mobile flow and
            create the experience the client is desiring and meet user needs.
