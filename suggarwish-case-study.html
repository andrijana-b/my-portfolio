                <p class="cs-paragraph">Sugarwish is a unique gifting company based in Denver, Colorado. With a
                    Sugarwish, the gift buyer is
                    able to send an e-gift card digitally with no mailing address required. The gift recipient receives
                    the eCard and is invited to go to the Sugarwish website to pick their favorite treats or
                    beverages.</p>
                <p class="cs-paragraph">
                    As part of the UX/UI Academy at Brainster, we were asked to work on redesign on small subset of
                    screens of already existing website which use design system. Our ideas and final solution should be
                    designed in such a way that can be applied without influence on the consistency and the design of
                    the already existing website.

            First I conducted stakeholder interview to get more insights, which helped me to make the right decisions
            and avoid end moment disappointments. During this stakeholder interview, I learned that the purpose of the
            redesign has been tackled several times and the <span class="fw-bold">highest bounce rate</span> is on the
            <span class="fw-bold">page choose an e-card</span> and second on <span
                class="fw-bold">choose a size page</span>. With this information, I conducted a UX assessment to
            understand what needed to change to create the experience the client was desiring and meet user needs.

        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            Here are few questions that I asked:

            <li>What are your unique selling points?</li>
            <li>Are there any design constraints? If yes, what are they?</li>
            <li>Because this is redesign, in which phase of the user flow is high bounce rate?</li>
            <li>Is there any features on your website that give you advantage over your competitors?</li>

        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            Usability tests were conducted before any other research to determine the areas of the website that users
            found confusing and to potentially discover the existing pain-points.
            <span class="fw-bold">The usability test’s goal is to uncover flaws and things that are not straightforward
                in the designs. Using the test findings, we can iterate the designs and create a much better,

        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            Due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, I conducted my usability testing remotely over Zoom, asking
            participants to share their screens and think aloud while being recorded going through the Sugarwish
            website. I asked users to place themselves in the following scenario:
        </p>
        <ul class="cs-bullet-points">
            <li>Visit <a href="https://sugarwish.com/" target="_blank">www.sugarwish.com</a>, choose happy birthday card

            </li>
            <li>Visit <a href="https://sugarwish.com/" target="_blank">www.sugarwish.com</a> and buy medium box of candy
                for five recipients. At the end edit the box and instead of medium buy large box popcorn.

        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            User interviews were conducted after the usability testing so that I could understand better the users and
            what their needs and frustrations were. I conducted 3 face to face user interviews to understand their
            frustrations. The biggest surprise was some of the users considered that the site might be a <span
                class="fw-bold">"scam"</span> because
            via the option <span class="fw-bold">"send the card via FB" there is no entry point for that particular information</span>.
            The other
            given options for sending the eCard are Messaging and Print which were also not clear how they work and
            users were in doubt how to use them, and who print the card.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            <span class="fw-bold">E-cards page</span>, users found the design of the cards a little <span

            recipients are able to select the product type first (e.g. candy, popcorn, or cookies), and then choose
            their favorites within that product category. But even though the select is the most unique product and
            represents as high as 80% of Sugarwish sales user were confused about the product option <span

            According to Jacob’s Law, users prefer every site to work the same way as all the other sites they already
            know, therefore we embedded our decisions in the ux theories and common e-commerce practices. We based
            almost all our descriptions and solutions on the results that we got from our usability testings. One that
            help us determine the pain points on the website and another that helped us to check whether our solutions
            have improved the same.

                    the product is different from the rest.

                    We re re-designed "The Select" card, explaining it with a simple copy text, and improving the

                    hierarchy on the page and this time being very cautious about how we are using the color.

                    We redesigned the price cards so that the whole content is visible for the user without scrolling.
                    With this design also the content regarding the products and flavors is above the fold, now it’s
                    more visible for the user and harder to miss.

                    Almost all of the users were confused about the page with eCards, firstly because too many similar

                    Following the UX principles regarding the “movement of the eyes” on a website, I moved the Occasion

                <p>
                    I changed the cards, and limited the choice. Also, if the “See All” category is selected only six
                    featured cards would be visible (as in all other categories), to prevent the user from getting
                    confused or frustrated about their choice.

                <p>
                    I also added the video explaining what happens with the chosen card and how the recipient would

                    To avoid further frustrations and confusion I designed page where I added all this features where

                    The shopping card icon do not indicate the number of the items in it making it a bit confusing for
                    the users whether they have successfully added something into the cart or not.

                    During the second usability testing the remark we got was that the “Log In” option should be
                    optional and at the very end of the flow, perhaps where the cart is.

                <ul>
                    <li>The shopping card icon now shows the number of items in it, making it easier for the users to
                        keep track of what they are buying.
                    </li>
                    <li>I added a Continue shopping button, to signal to users they can easily leave the cart without
                        losing its content or they can proceed with the payment.
                    </li>
                    <li>I followed our users preference and I moved the login option at the very end of the user flow,
                        where the recipient can preview their complete order and where they can proceed with the
                        payment.

                        To avoid any confusion among our users, I designed slide out panel with system feedback massage
                        that would notify the users that their card is empty if they haven’t purchase anything yet.

        <h1>Client feedback</h1>
        <h5>Team Sharks - the best solution</h5>
        <p>We feel that from all the teams Sharks had the best desktop solution for the flow. We liked the size
            presentations on the Choose size screen and the simple filters for the eCards. The recipient page was a
            little messy, but it still followed established patterns. We appreciated the complete approach that the
            group took before dealing with the actual problems. Based on their studies they identified specific issues
            (aka pain points) and addressed them accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>It would have been great to see how the group would address the mobile flow, but the absence of mobile
            screens is not taken as a negative.</p>

        <h1>My learnings & Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            It was a fun yet quite challenging experience working on this project because it was first time for me doing
            re-design with the main focus only on one part of the website which is customer experience of ordering
            section.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project taught me how to work within the constraints of an existing product and design within an
            existing system, relying on already present design patterns and components. Since users are already familiar
            with these conventions, breaking them could hurt usability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most importantly I learnt that the first ideas for the website are only the beginning of the design process
            and “no design is perfect, there is always a room for improvements”.
        </p>
        <p>
            Usability testing and feedback influenced each iteration of the sugarwish ordering flow design and that
            point to me to appreciate gradual improvement rather than striving to perfectionism.
