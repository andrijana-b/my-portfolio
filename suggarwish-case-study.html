        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            Sugarwish is a unique gifting startup company based in Denver, Colorado. With a Sugarwish, the gift
            buyer is able to send an e-gift card digitally with no mailing address required. The gift recipient
            receives the eCard and is invited to go to the Sugarwish website to pick their favorite treats or
            beverages.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            As part of the UX/UI Academy at Brainster, we were asked to work on redesign on small subset of
            screens of already existing website. Our ideas and final solution should be designed in
            such a way that can be applied without influence on the consistency and the design of the already
            existing website.

            The main points of the user

        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            We kicked off the project by conducted stakeholder interview to get more insights, which helped me to make
            the right decisions and avoid end moment disappointments. During this stakeholder interview, I learned that
            the purpose of the redesign has been tackled several times and the
            <span class="fw-bold">highest bounce rate</span> is on the
            <span class="fw-bold">page choose an e-card</span> and second on
            <span class="fw-bold">choose a size page</span>.
            With this information, I conducted a UX assessment to understand
            what needed to change to create the experience the client was desiring and meet user needs. The UX
            assessment included: Competitive UX analysis, Usability heuristic evaluation, Google reviews.

        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            Usability tests were conducted before any other research to determine the areas of the website that users
            found confusing and to potentially discover the existing pain-points.
            <span class="fw-bold">The usability test’s goal is to uncover flaws and things that are not straightforward
                in the designs. Using the test findings, we can iterate the designs and create a much better,

        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            Due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, I conducted my usability testing remotely over Zoom, asking
            participants to share their screens and think aloud while being recorded going through the Sugarwish
            website. I asked users to place themselves in the following scenario:
        </p>
        <ul class="cs-bullet-points">
            <li>Visit sugarwish website, choose happy birthday card
                and buy a gift for one recipient. Your budget is 50&#36;.
            </li>
            <li>Visit sugarwish website and buy medium box of candy
                for five recipients. At the end edit the box and instead of medium, buy large box popcorn.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            We created a user flow which detects the pain points of our users, at each step. Below are shown the key

            User interviews were conducted after the usability testing so that I could understand better the users and
            what their needs and frustrations were. I conducted 3 face to face user interviews to understand their
            frustrations. The biggest surprise was some of the users considered that the site might be a <span
                class="fw-bold">"scam"</span> because
            via the option <span class="fw-bold">"send the card via FB" there is no entry point for that particular information</span>.
            The other
            given options for sending the eCard are Messaging and Print which were also not clear how they work and
            users were in doubt how to use them, and who print the card.

        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            <span class="fw-bold">E-cards page</span>, users found the design of the cards a little <span

                    My biggest challenge at this point was to simplify the steps and adapt the flow to the users’
                    expectations, in order to provide a pleasant journey and avoid confusion and frustration.

                    What I did it was a simple <span class="fw-bold">merging of the three slide out panels (Log in, Sending eCard and Add

                    To avoid further frustrations and confusion I designed page where I added all this features where
                    users can:

                <ul class="cs-bullet-points">

                    <li><span class="fw-bold">added an option to send the eCard today or schedule for later,</span>
                        making it possible for the user to completely skip the calendar step and to lower the cognitive
                        load all together if they don’t want to go through the dates.

        <p class="cs-paragraph outcomes">
            We feel that from all the teams Sharks had the best desktop solution for the flow. We liked the size
            presentations on the Choose size screen and the simple filters for the eCards. The recipient page was a
            little messy, but it still followed established patterns. We appreciated the complete approach that the
            group took before dealing with the actual problems. Based on their studies they identified specific
            issues
            (aka pain points) and addressed them accordingly.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph outcomes">
            It would have been great to see how the group would address the mobile flow, but the absence of mobile
            screens is not taken as a negative.

        <h1 class="cs-section-title spacer-up">Lessons learned, and where we go from here</h1>
        <p class="cs-paragraph outcomes">
            It was a fun yet quite challenging experience working on this project because it was first time for me doing
            re-design on small subset of screens of already existing website.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph outcomes">
            This project taught me how to work within the constraints of an existing product and design within an
            existing system, relying on already present design patterns and components. Since users are already familiar
            with these conventions, breaking them could hurt usability.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph outcomes">
            Most importantly I learnt that the first ideas for the website are only the beginning of the design process
            and "no design is perfect, there is always a room for improvements". Usability testing and feedback
            influenced each iteration of the sugarwish ordering flow design and that point to me to appreciate gradual
            improvement rather than striving to perfectionism.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph outcomes">
            Based on the feedback of the stakeholder, the next steps for this project are to work on iteration on "The
            recipient page" and get it into the hands of more users for further validation. Create mobile flow and
            create the experience the client is desiring and meet user needs.
