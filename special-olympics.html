            The Special Olympics of North Macedonia, even though it is a very active organization, with plenty of
            members and achievements both on a national and international level, did not have an official website where
            they can inform the public and members about ongoing activities and the noble work they are doing. Instead,
            the organization has relied on facebook and traditional media such as television and radio to share its
            message.

            To gain inspiration and identify best practices for our website, we conducted a competitive analysis. We
            began by looking at the websites of several Special Olympics including SO General, SO Sweden, SO Washington,
            SO France and SO UK.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            One common feature we identified across these websites was the <span class="fw-bold">placement of the donate button in order to
            emphasize it as the main call to action. This was an important design pattern to consider in order to make
            it easier and more efficient for users to get involved and donate.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            Another common design pattern we observed was that each non-profit prominently displayed their <span
                class="fw-bold">mission
            statement at the beginning of their homepage</span>. This was an important method to effectively communicate
            nonprofit's mission to the user and help them better understand what the organization does.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            On the donate page, many non-profits had <span class="fw-bold">pre-determined donation amounts</span> in

        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            Before diving into the designs, I started with low-fidelity sketches. This technique enables me to move fast
            and explore different ideas before settling on a direction. I sketched out most of the pages but the most
            challenging part was to nail the donation page.

            <br><span class="fw-bold">Why was this a challenge?</span>

            payment slip.
            According to the research we conducted, 5 out of 10 people still make mistakes or are confused when filling in
            a payment slip.
            <br>
            Therefore, in our design I have included an example of how to fill in a payment slip, so it will be easier
            for the users to make a donation.

        <h1 class="cs-section-title">Lessons learned</h1>
        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            When this project was given to us, we were at the beginning of our UX Academy, and we had never met each
            other.
            It was a great learning experience to apply our new UX skills, whilst working as a team.
            We all had very different backgrounds and skills to bring to the table. At first, it took a while for us to
            adjust to each otherâ€™s working styles.
            However, halfway through the project we did a retrospective session, and I was appointed as a team lead.
            As a team lead I ensured that everyone had opportunity to share their idea with a focus to our project to
            move forward.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            There was time when a teammate and I had ideas that were so different that we wouldn't be able to
            realistically accommodate both in our design.
            Having to make a decision to choose between one or the other was hard. At the end, what I learned is not
            which design is selected or which designer is correct. What matters is which design will lead to a better
            experience for the user.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-paragraph">
            I found it really valuable to have a retrospective, to have that open and honest conversation of where we
            were doing great and where we could improve. These steps made a huge difference, and we worked as a
            productive, efficient and happy team.
